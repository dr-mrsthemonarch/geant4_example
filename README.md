# A basic example of Geant4

This is just a simple repo to follow up with the howto from my other repo, to give an example program that is a bit more complex than the basic code from the geant4 examples, but probably completely wrong in physics. 

It should however provide a fairly nice skeleton to make more complex reasonable simulations. I expect I will continue to add bits and pieces until I figure out how to output data.
